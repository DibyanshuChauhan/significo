# Significo - Tailwind CSS Practice Project

## Overview
Significo is a simple web page replica created as a practice project using **Tailwind CSS** utility classes. This project marks my first hands-on experience with Tailwind CSS, where I aimed to build a responsive and modern UI without relying on vanilla CSS. It served as an excellent introduction to utility-first CSS and provided valuable insights into structuring components efficiently.

### Key Features:
- **Fully Responsive Layout**: Designed to work across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Utility-First Approach**: Built exclusively using Tailwind CSS utility classes for a clean and maintainable codebase.
- **Modern Web Practices**: Includes best practices for layout structuring, spacing, and component reusability.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS** (no vanilla CSS used)
- **JavaScript** (for interactivity and dynamic behavior)
- **VS Code** (editor of choice)
- **Git** (version control)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the project locally, ensure you have:
- **Node.js** installed (comes with npm).
- **Git** installed for cloning the repository.
- **Code editor** (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.).

### Installation Steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DibyanshuChauhan/significo.git

2.  Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ```bash
    cd significo
```
3.  Install Tailwind CSS: Since Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework, it requires the installation of dependencies. In the project directory, run:

   ```bash
npm install
  ```
4.  Start the Development Server: To preview the project locally, run the following command:
   ```bash
npm run dev
```

# How to Customize
<p>To make changes to the project, follow these steps:</p>

1.  Modify HTML Files: Navigate through src folder, where you can edit or add HTML components according to your design requirements.

2.  Edit Tailwind Configurations: To tweak Tailwind’s default configurations (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.), modify the tailwind.config.js file.

3.  Extend Utilities: You can extend the default utility classes to fit custom styles or create custom components.

4.  Run Build: When changes are made, run the following command to compile the updated assets:
```bash
  npm run build
 ```
5.  Deploying: Once finalized, you can deploy your project using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Github Pages.

# Best Practices to Follow:
Utility Composition: Build reusable components by composing Tailwind’s utility classes.

Mobile-First Approach: Always start designing mobile-first for responsiveness.

Maintain Clean Code: Utilize Tailwind’s default naming conventions to keep classes clean and readable.
